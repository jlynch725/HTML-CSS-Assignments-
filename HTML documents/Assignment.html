				The EPIC Pass is multi resort multi day and season pass – 
				the number of days access and blackout dates depend on which 
				one you purchase. The EPIC Pass options are only available 
				in limited quantities and once the sales quota is reached each season,
				they will no longer be available to purchase – until the following season.
